# Internship Journey at Solutions3 LLC

Welcome to my documentation hub! I'm currently an intern at **Solutions3 LLC**, where I'm rotating through various cybersecurity pathways to build hands-on skills and industry knowledge. This repository serves as a living journal of my experience, insights, and learning progress throughout the program.

## 🌐 About the Internship

As part of my internship, I am exploring key focus areas within cybersecurity:

### 🔐 Cyber Essentials  
This rotation introduces the core concepts of cybersecurity, including threat landscapes, common vulnerabilities, network defense tools, and foundational best practices.

### 🚨 Incident Response  
In this phase, I’m learning how organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. This includes exposure to threat hunting, response procedures, and containment strategies.

### 📋 Risk Management Framework (RMF)  
During this rotation, I’m diving into NIST’s RMF process—understanding how to assess and manage risk, prepare documentation, and support compliance in secure systems development.

## 📅 Weekly Updates

I’ll be updating this repository regularly as I rotate through each domain, so feel free to follow along with my learning!
